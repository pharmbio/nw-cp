By integrating these cutting-edge techniques, we can harness the power of high-dimensional data within the context of network medicine, providing valuable insights into how chemical compounds, diseases, proteins, and genes are related. This research project explores the potential of graph representation learning to analyze cell profiling data and reveal hidden connections that could help drive drug discovery. There has been substantial progress in graph representation learning in recent years, a subfield of machine learning that deals with processing and analyzing graphs or networks. For a wide range of applications, including social networks, molecular interactions, and recommendation systems, graph neural networks (GNNs) and other graph-based machine learning algorithms have been developed to model complex relationships between nodes and edges. By predicting protein-protein interactions, understanding the association between genes and diseases, and discovering new drug targets, graph representation learning has shown promise in the context of biological and biomedical data. Through the analysis of underlying mechanisms in health and disease, these techniques have the potential to uncover novel insights and deepen our understanding of the underlying structure and relationships within complex biological networks. Meanwhile, cell profiling has emerged as a powerful high-throughput approach to quantifying the phenotypic features of cells under various conditions, such as genetic alterations or chemical perturbations. In drug discovery, functional genomics, and personalized medicine, cell profiling can be used to evaluate cellular response to different stimuli rapidly and accurately. Researchers can analyze cell images to extract meaningful features, enabling them to characterize cellular phenotypes and identify biomarkers associated with specific diseases or treatments using advanced imaging techniques and computational methods. As a result of combining graph representation learning with cell profiling, we offer an innovative way to analyze cellular response data that contains a wealth of information. Using this integration, we will be able to construct an integrated network of chemical perturbations, cellular phenotypes, and other biological entities. Graph representation learning techniques will then be employed to identify hidden relationships and patterns within the network, potentially uncovering new drug targets, combinations of therapies, or mechanisms of action that may not have been apparent through traditional analysis methods. GNNs have been demonstrated to be effective in analyzing morphological profiles of cellular responses to drug perturbations in studies such as Xie et al. (2021). An innovative and powerful method of analyzing complex biomedical data can be found in the intersection of graph representation learning and cell profiling. The goal of our research is to unlock new insights into how chemical compounds, cellular phenotypes, and biological entities interact, ultimately facilitating the discovery and development of new drugs. 1.1 Graph representation learning The concept of networks has become ubiquitous in biology and medicine. They can represent molecular interaction, protein-protein relations, gene-disease connection and etc. Biomedical knowledge and biological systems represented as graphs are more useful due to the multitude of biological entities and associations they hold. Understandably this became a highly effective motivation for the development of deep learning techniques that can be performed on networks. These machine learning methods are generally categorised under graph representation learning. Also, finding architectural features of molecular interaction in the cell follows the same pattern that we can observe in different complex networks allowed the expertise from well-understood non-biological systems like the World Wide Web or social sciences, to be useful in characterizing relationships that govern the biological systems too. Additionally, networks are often multi-modal and diverse in terms of data and this not only enhances the performance of predictive deep-learning models but also enables their broad generalization. Besides, it makes the models easier to interpret and understand(Li, Huang, and Zitnik 2022). Graphs (networks) map out different biological entities to a set of nodes and links. Nodes or vertices are the components of the biological system like proteins, genes, drug compounds or any other entities. Links or edges are the interaction or relation between two components (nodes). The structure of the graph can be explained by these topological units. Together they will define the dynamics of the network(Barabasi and Oltvai 2004). Graph descriptors categories Networks can be mathematically represented and analyzed through their topology and dynamics. Nodes (N) represent the components of a system, and links or edges (L) represent the interactions between those components. There are several size-dependent descriptors for networks, such as the degree (k), path length (l), and clustering coefficient (C), which help to quantify the connectivity, navigability, and local interconnectedness of networks, respectively. Additionally, size-independent descriptors like the degree distribution (P(k)) and the average clustering coefficient with k links (C(k)) offer insights into the network’s hierarchical character (Graph descriptors categories). Aside from these units and descriptors, there are often hierarchical modules in the complex graphs. For instance, a subset of nodes that are connected to each other in a specific wiring diagram is called a subgraph and those subgraphs that occur more frequently in the graph are called motifs. Motifs and subgraphs can be used to define a highly interconnected group of nodes with relatively distinct functions or behaviour which seems to be a property of all complex networks(Stamile, Marzullo, and Deusebio 2021). Network architectures also can be categorized into various models, such as scale-free, random, and hierarchical networks. Scale-free networks are highly non-uniform, with a small number of nodes having many links and most nodes having few links. These networks exhibit a power-law degree distribution, with a degree exponent γ. Hierarchical networks, on the other hand, are characterized by their modularity, local clustering, and scale-free topology, and can be described by iterative clustering. Random networks are more uniform, with links placed randomly and a Poisson degree distribution. The widely-used machine-learning approach for graphs is representation learning. There are several types of graphs that can be used for representation learning. Graphs can be simple, weighted, multi-modal, knowledge-based, multi-layer or temporal. Nodes and edges can also be spatial elements of a multi-dimensional space e.g., a spatial representation of cell interactions in euclidean space or a 3D point cloud of the molecule’s atomic coordinates. All in all, the aim of ML is to realize the essence of graphs. The first step usually is to transform nodes and edges to a lower vectorial space which is called embedding. After embedding the complex structure of the graph into lower space, different types of machine-learning techniques can be performed on the data(Zhang et al. 2018). Complex networks exhibit several interesting features, such as the small-world effect, disassortativity, and hierarchical modularity. The small-world effect implies that any two nodes can be connected with a path of only a few links. Disassortativity refers to the tendency of highly connected nodes (hubs) to avoid linking directly to each other, while nodes of low degree are more likely to connect with nodes of high degree. Hierarchical modularity is evident in the presence of motifs (subgraphs occurring more frequently in the network), motif clusters, and modules (clusters of highly interconnected nodes with distinct functions or behaviors). Graph representation learning has become a leading machine learning approach for networks, allowing for the principles of networks to be realized in a compact vectorial space, or embeddings. This technique involves specifying nonlinear transformation functions that map nodes to points in the embedding space. Various types of graphs can be used for representation learning, including simple, weighted, attributed, multimodal, heterogeneous, knowledge graphs, multi-layer graphs, temporal graphs, and spatial graphs. These graph types can be combined to create new objects, such as multi-layer spatial or multimodal temporal graphs. In conclusion, network science and graph representation learning have become increasingly important tools for studying complex systems. By leveraging the power of these techniques, researchers can gain new insights into the structure and dynamics of complex networks in various fields, leading to a deeper understanding of the world around us. 1.2 Cell profiling Image-based cell profiling is a high-throughput and relatively cheap method to quantify the phenotype features of a cell line. This is particularly important in distinguishing the healthy and diseased states of the cell. Studies showed the great capability of this method in disease recognition or looking for many treatments effect within a single day. The output of this high-throughput microscopy is images which by itself can be an excellent source of unbiased information for analysis. There have been numerous studies that used deep learning on these images and resulted in models with unmatched power for identifying disease-specific phenotypes in clinical diagnostics and chemical lead hopping in drug discovery and so on. Additionally, specific phenotype features of any perturbation can be extracted to be used for data mining and profile analysis(Rietdijk et al. 2022). Alongside genetic alteration, chemical perturbation in cellular profiling also presented itself as a promising high throughput screening method that can potentially pave the 1.3 Why graph representation learning? When dealing with data structured as graphs or networks, such as cell painting data, graph representation learning provides a powerful alternative to conventional deep learning techniques. The cell painting technique uses dyes to stain multiple cell compartments to capture rich morphological information. The inherent complexity and relational nature of cell painting data can be more effectively modeled using graph representation learning techniques and here’s why. Graph representation learning is explicitly designed to model complex relationships between nodes (entities) and edges (connections) within a graph, whereas deep learning techniques, such as feedforward neural networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), use fixed-size inputs. As graph representation learning retains the inherent structure and connections in the data, it can better capture dependencies and interactions between entities, improving prediction performance. Also, the graph representation learning algorithm can handle a variety of input data types. Learning can be enhanced by including rich, multimodal information to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying relationships. By doing so, we can include more information about a compound, such as its connection to proteins or biological pathways. Furthermore, graph representation learning algorithms are invariant to isomorphism. They can produce consistent node embeddings and predictions regardless of the order or label of the nodes. For graph-structured data, this property is especially important, as it ensures that learned representations and models are resilient to arbitrary relabeling or reordering. Since conventional deep learning techniques are sensitive to the order or arrangement of input features, graph data may limit their applicability and performance. Finnaly , the sparse and local nature of graph data can be exploited to make graph representation learning and inference efficient. In GraphSAGE and GraphConvolutional Networks (GCNs), for example, localized convolutional operations are applied to graphs, enabling efficient neighborhood information aggregation and scalable learning of large-scale graphs. In contrast, conventional deep learning techniques may require dense representations or extensive memory resources, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional input data.
