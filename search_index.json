By integrating these cutting-edge techniques, we can harness the power of high-dimensional data within the context of network medicine, providing valuable insights into how chemical compounds, diseases, proteins, and genes are related. This research project explores the potential of graph representation learning to analyze cell profiling data and reveal hidden connections that could help drive drug discovery. There has been substantial progress in graph representation learning in recent years, a subfield of machine learning that deals with processing and analyzing graphs or networks. For a wide range of applications, including social networks, molecular interactions, and recommendation systems, graph neural networks (GNNs) and other graph-based machine learning algorithms have been developed to model complex relationships between nodes and edges. By predicting protein-protein interactions, understanding the association between genes and diseases, and discovering new drug targets, graph representation learning has shown promise in the context of biological and biomedical data. Through the analysis of underlying mechanisms in health and disease, these techniques have the potential to uncover novel insights and deepen our understanding of the underlying structure and relationships within complex biological networks. Meanwhile, cell profiling has emerged as a powerful high-throughput approach to quantifying the phenotypic features of cells under various conditions, such as genetic alterations or chemical perturbations. In drug discovery, functional genomics, and personalized medicine, cell profiling can be used to evaluate cellular response to different stimuli rapidly and accurately. Researchers can analyze cell images to extract meaningful features, enabling them to characterize cellular phenotypes and identify biomarkers associated with specific diseases or treatments using advanced imaging techniques and computational methods. As a result of combining graph representation learning with cell profiling, we offer an innovative way to analyze cellular response data that contains a wealth of information. Using this integration, we will be able to construct an integrated network of chemical perturbations, cellular phenotypes, and other biological entities. Graph representation learning techniques will then be employed to identify hidden relationships and patterns within the network, potentially uncovering new drug targets, combinations of therapies, or mechanisms of action that may not have been apparent through traditional analysis methods. GNNs have been demonstrated to be effective in analyzing morphological profiles of cellular responses to drug perturbations in studies such as Xie et al. (2021). An innovative and powerful method of analyzing complex biomedical data can be found in the intersection of graph representation learning and cell profiling. The goal of our research is to unlock new insights into how chemical compounds, cellular phenotypes, and biological entities interact, ultimately facilitating the discovery and development of new drugs. 1.1 Graphs The concept of networks has become ubiquitous in biology and medicine. They can represent molecular interaction, protein-protein relations, gene-disease connection and etc. Biomedical knowledge and biological systems represented as graphs are more useful due to the multitude of biological entities and associations they hold. Understandably this became a highly effective motivation for the development of deep learning techniques that can be performed on networks. These machine learning methods are generally categorised under graph representation learning. Also, finding architectural features of molecular interaction in the cell follows the same pattern that we can observe in different complex networks allowed the expertise from well-understood non-biological systems like the World Wide Web or social sciences, to be useful in characterizing relationships that govern the biological systems too. Additionally, networks are often multi-modal and diverse in terms of data and this not only enhances the performance of predictive deep-learning models but also enables their broad generalization. Besides, it makes the models easier to interpret and understand(li2022graph?). Graphs (networks) map out different biological entities to a set of nodes and links. Nodes or vertices are the components of the biological system like proteins, genes, drug compounds or any other entities. Links or edges are the interaction or relation between two components (nodes). The structure of the graph can be explained by these topological units. Together they will define the dynamics of the network(barabasi2004network?). Graph descriptors categories Networks can be mathematically represented and analyzed through their topology and dynamics. Nodes (N) represent the components of a system, and links or edges (L) represent the interactions between those components. There are several size-dependent descriptors for networks, such as the degree (k), path length (l), and clustering coefficient (C), which help to quantify the connectivity, navigability, and local interconnectedness of networks, respectively. Additionally, size-independent descriptors like the degree distribution (P(k)) and the average clustering coefficient with k links (C(k)) offer insights into the network’s hierarchical character (Graph descriptors categories). Aside from these units and descriptors, there are often hierarchical modules in the complex graphs. For instance, a subset of nodes that are connected to each other in a specific wiring diagram is called a subgraph and those subgraphs that occur more frequently in the graph are called motifs. Motifs and subgraphs can be used to define a highly interconnected group of nodes with relatively distinct functions or behaviour which seems to be a property of all complex networks(Stamile2021Jun?). Network architectures also can be categorized into various models, such as scale-free, random, and hierarchical networks. Scale-free networks are highly non-uniform, with a small number of nodes having many links and most nodes having few links. These networks exhibit a power-law degree distribution, with a degree exponent γ. Hierarchical networks, on the other hand, are characterized by their modularity, local clustering, and scale-free topology, and can be described by iterative clustering. Random networks are more uniform, with links placed randomly and a Poisson degree distribution. The widely-used machine-learning approach for graphs is representation learning. There are several types of graphs that can be used for representation learning. Graphs can be simple, weighted, multi-modal, knowledge-based, multi-layer or temporal. Nodes and edges can also be spatial elements of a multi-dimensional space e.g., a spatial representation of cell interactions in euclidean space or a 3D point cloud of the molecule’s atomic coordinates. All in all, the aim of ML is to realize the essence of graphs. The first step usually is to transform nodes and edges to a lower vectorial space which is called embedding. After embedding the complex structure of the graph into lower space, different types of machine-learning techniques can be performed on the data(zhang2018network?). Summary on network basics Complex networks exhibit several interesting features, such as the small-world effect, disassortativity, and hierarchical modularity. The small-world effect implies that any two nodes can be connected with a path of only a few links. Disassortativity refers to the tendency of highly connected nodes (hubs) to avoid linking directly to each other, while nodes of low degree are more likely to connect with nodes of high degree. Hierarchical modularity is evident in the presence of motifs (subgraphs occurring more frequently in the network), motif clusters, and modules (clusters of highly interconnected nodes with distinct functions or behaviors). Graph representation learning has become a leading machine learning approach for networks, allowing for the principles of networks to be realized in a compact vectorial space, or embeddings. This technique involves specifying nonlinear transformation functions that map nodes to points in the embedding space. Various types of graphs can be used for representation learning, including simple, weighted, attributed, multimodal, heterogeneous, knowledge graphs, multi-layer graphs, temporal graphs, and spatial graphs. These graph types can be combined to create new objects, such as multi-layer spatial or multimodal temporal graphs. In conclusion, network science and graph representation learning have become increasingly important tools for studying complex systems. By leveraging the power of these techniques, researchers can gain new insights into the structure and dynamics of complex networks in various fields, leading to a deeper understanding of the world around us. 1.2 Graph representation learning For understanding complex networks and extracting meaningful information from them, graph representation learning has emerged as a powerful approach. To achieve various downstream tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, graph data must be learned and encoded to learn and encode their inherent structure and features. We will provide a brief overview of graph representation learning concepts and methods, emphasizing their relevance in various applications, in this section. Graph embedding methods aim to represent nodes, edges, or entire graphs as continuous low-dimensional vectors while preserving the underlying graph structure. These embeddings can be derived using both unsupervised and supervised learning paradigms. Through the use of graph connectivity patterns, unsupervised methods like DeepWalk, node2vec, and LINE learn latent feature representations, while supervised methods like GraphSAGE and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) utilize node features and labels to guide the learning process. In the realm of graph neural networks (GNNs), message-passing techniques like GGSNN and MPNN provide a powerful way to learn node and edge representations by propagating and aggregating information from local neighborhoods. These methods have been extended to non-Euclidean domains with frameworks like ChebyNet, GAT, and MoNet, which capture the intrinsic geometry and topology of the graph. An important aspect of graph representation learning is the development of autoencoders, such as SDNE, DNGR, and VGAE, which are able to learn low-dimensional embeddings without supervision based on the graph’s structure. To reconstruct the original graph from the learned embeddings, matrix factorization, skip-gram models, and other techniques are often employed. Autoencoders can also be combined with graph regularization and manifold learning methods, such as Isomap, MDS, and LLE, to further improve the quality of the learned representations. For generating graphs with desirable properties or learning latent graph spaces, graph generation models have been developed, such as GCPN, JT-VAE, and GraphRNN. In applications like drug discovery, generating new chemical structures with specific characteristics is of paramount importance, which makes these models particularly useful. Graph representation learning methods There have been significant advancements in drug discovery, genomics, and proteomics due to machine learning applied to biomedical graphs. Different real-world problems have been studied and applied to canonical graph prediction tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. Furthermore, recent advances in latent graph learning have shown promise in uncovering hidden patterns within complex networks. It has already shown that graph representation learning has the potential to transform our understanding of complex networks as it is a rapidly evolving research area. Researchers continue to develop innovative approaches for analyzing and modeling graph data by combining graph theory, network diffusion, topological data analysis, and manifold learning. The vast and complex world of graphs will become even more meaningful as our knowledge in this field advances. 1.3 Cell profiling Cell painting and cell profiling are advanced high-content imaging and analysis techniques used in cell biology to comprehensively characterize cellular phenotypes. These methods combine high-throughput microscopy with computational analysis to simultaneously investigate multiple cellular features, enabling the study of complex biological systems and the discovery of novel drug targets or biomarkers. his is particularly important in distinguishing the healthy and diseased states of the cell. Studies showed the great capability of this method in disease recognition or looking for many treatments effect within a single day. The output of this high-throughput microscopy is images which by itself can be an excellent source of unbiased information for analysis. There have been numerous studies that used deep learning on these images and resulted in models with unmatched power for identifying disease-specific phenotypes in clinical diagnostics and chemical lead hopping in drug discovery and so on. Additionally, specific phenotype features of any perturbation can be extracted to be used for data mining and profile analysis(Rietdijk et al. 2022). With cell painting, different type of dyes are used to stain cells and target specific subcellular compartments or structures. By multiplexing several cellular features, including organelles, cytoskeletons, and nuclear compartments, several cellular features can be visualized simultaneously. By imaging stained cells with high-throughput microscopy, numerous morphological, textural, and intensity-based features are captured, resulting in a wealth of quantitative data. Subsequently, cell profiling is employed to analyze the acquired images. This process leverages computational algorithms, such as machine learning and deep learning, to extract quantitative information from the images. The resulting high-dimensional data, often referred to as “features” or “phenotypic fingerprints”, is used to classify cells, identify functional relationships, or reveal previously unrecognized patterns. These methods have been used to address various biological questions. Bray et al. (2016), for example, utilized these techniques to create a morphological map of human cells exposed to a variety of bioactive compounds. The results of their research have led to the identification of novel compound-target interactions, demonstrated the potential of cell painting as a tool for high-throughput drug discovery, and provided a comprehensive resource for the scientific community. In addition, cell painting and cell profiling have allowed scientists to dissect signaling pathways, elucidate gene function, and understand disease mechanisms. Aside from uncovering novel gene functions and dissecting cellular networks, researchers have used these methods to study how genetic or chemical perturbations affect cell phenotypes. Drug discovery, precision medicine, and basic research can all benefit from cell painting and cell profiling. In addition to revealing novel drug targets, these techniques can also identify potential therapeutic compounds and elucidate the mechanisms underlying disease pathology by providing a comprehensive, systems-level view of cellular phenotypes. The high-throughput nature of these methods also allows rapid screening of vast compound libraries or genetic perturbations, which accelerates scientific discovery and facilitates the development of personalized therapeutics. Our understanding of cellular biology has been greatly enriched by the use of cell painting and cell profiling, powerful, high-content imaging and analysis techniques. These methods have aided in the discovery of new drugs, precision medicine, and basic research by offering a comprehensive view of cellular phenotypes, and they remain an essential tool in modern cell biology. 1.4 Why graph representation learning? When dealing with data structured as graphs or networks, such as cell painting data, graph representation learning provides a powerful alternative to conventional deep learning techniques. The cell painting technique uses dyes to stain multiple cell compartments to capture rich morphological information. The inherent complexity and relational nature of cell painting data can be more effectively modeled using graph representation learning techniques and here’s why. Graph representation learning is explicitly designed to model complex relationships between nodes (entities) and edges (connections) within a graph, whereas deep learning techniques, such as feedforward neural networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), use fixed-size inputs. As graph representation learning retains the inherent structure and connections in the data, it can better capture dependencies and interactions between entities, improving prediction performance. Also, the graph representation learning algorithm can handle a variety of input data types. Learning can be enhanced by including rich, multimodal information to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying relationships. By doing so, we can include more information about a compound, such as its connection to proteins or biological pathways. Furthermore, graph representation learning algorithms are invariant to isomorphism. They can produce consistent node embeddings and predictions regardless of the order or label of the nodes. For graph-structured data, this property is especially important, as it ensures that learned representations and models are resilient to arbitrary relabeling or reordering. Since conventional deep learning techniques are sensitive to the order or arrangement of input features, graph data may limit their applicability and performance. Finnaly , the sparse and local nature of graph data can be exploited to make graph representation learning and inference efficient. In GraphSAGE and GraphConvolutional Networks (GCNs), for example, localized convolutional operations are applied to graphs, enabling efficient neighborhood information aggregation and scalable learning of large-scale graphs. In contrast, conventional deep learning techniques may require dense representations or extensive memory resources, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional input data.

High-dimensional cell profiling data was collected from the Pharmaceutical Bioinformatics Research Group at Uppsala University. The data encompassed various cellular phenotypes under chemical perturbations. The data was then preprocessed and normalized to ensure uniformity and mitigate the effects of batch variations and other noise. Additionally, chemical compound information, including molecular structure and other biological entities like proteins and biological pathways, was collected from several relevant databases. Initial data preprocessing was performed using the polars and pandas Python packages for data manipulation. Any inconsistencies, outliers, and missing values were identified and handled appropriately to ensure data integrity. The main analytical technique used in this study is graph representation learning. The analysis was predominantly performed in Python (version 3.8), with a variety of libraries. PyTorch (version 1.13.1+cu116), a deep learning framework that allows for flexible and efficient model building and training, was used. For the implementation of graph neural networks (GNNs), both PyTorch Geometric (version 2.2.0) and Deep Graph Library (DGL, version 1.0.1+cu116) were utilized. These libraries are extensions of PyTorch designed specifically for graph representation learning, supporting a variety of GNN models and providing efficient and scalable implementations. DeepChem (version 2.7.1) was utilized for pre-processing and some featurization of chemical compounds. Physico-chemical featurization were performed by RDKit and Mordred library. TorchDrug (version 0.2.0.post1), an emerging toolkit for drug discovery, was used to create network architectures for drug generation tasks. Chemoinformatics operations, such as converting chemical structures to molecular graphs, were carried out using RDKit (version 2022.09.5). The Scikit-learn library was employed for general machine learning tasks, including model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning. For the visualization of the data and results, Plotly, a graphing library that enables the creation of interactive and high-quality visualizations, was primarily used. All statistical analyses were performed using the Scikit-learn library in Python and some specific analyses were conducted in the R programming language. The analyses included standard measures of model performance, as well as more complex analyses like feature importance ranking. By employing this combination of methods and materials, the intersection of graph representation learning and cell profiling was explored, revealing novel insights into the interactions between chemical compounds, cellular phenotypes, and biological entities. This integrated approach facilitated the discovery of new relationships and potential drug targets that may not have been apparent through traditional analysis methods. 2.2 Data Preprocessing 2.2.1 COVID-19 Cell profilling Data In this data processing, the dataset containing phenotype features and metadata for multiple images was prepared for analysis. The dataset was cleaned by dropping possible empty features and features with the same value. All the numeric columns were extracted, and the phenotype features were identified and extracted from these columns. Features with low variability were removed, based on their standard deviation. This dataset represents an extensive collection of phenotype features extracted from images, along with associated metadata. Each row in the dataset corresponds to a single image, with each image associated with a specific site within a well. There are 9 sites (numbered 1-9) within each well, and approximately 350-360 wells within each plate, with a maximum of 384 wells per plate. The dataset encompasses 24 plates.

The dataset was then segregated into numeric columns, further filtered down to ‘phenotype features’ and ‘metadata’. The ‘phenotype features’ included numeric columns excluding those with certain strings such as ‘Metadata’, ‘Number’, ‘Outlier’, ‘ImageQuality’, ‘cmpd_conc’, ‘Total’, ‘Flag’ and ‘Site’. The difference between the number of numeric columns and the number of phenotype features gives the number of ‘metadata’. numeric_columns = list() for a in df.columns: if (df.dtypes[a] &#39;float64&#39;) | (df.dtypes[a] &#39;int64&#39;) : numeric_columns.append(a) feature_columns = [fc for fc in numeric_columns if (&#39;Metadata&#39; not in fc) &amp; (&#39;Number&#39; not in fc) &amp; (&#39;Outlier&#39; not in fc) &amp; (&#39;ImageQuality&#39; not in fc) &amp; (&#39;cmpd_conc&#39; not in fc) &amp; (&#39;Total&#39; not in fc) &amp; (&#39;Flag&#39; not in fc) &amp; (&#39;Site&#39; not in fc) ] The preparation phase also involved removing any features with missing values and those with an SD less than 0.0001. X = df.loc[:, feature_columns] X.dropna(axis=1, inplace=True) X = X.loc[:, (X.std() &gt; 0.0001) ] 2.2.1.1 Normalization In the normalization phase, the features were normalized based on DMSO (control), both in a general approach (without plate separation) and separated by plates. In the general approach, the median of all data points was taken at once, and the Z-scores were calculated using the median and median absolute deviations (MADs) for DMSO. \\[Z = \\frac{X - DMSO_{median}}{|X_{dmso} - DMSO_{median}|_{median}}\\] where \\(X\\) is observed feature value, \\(DMSO_{median}\\) is median of DMSO and \\(X_{dmso}\\) is observed feature value of DMSO. dfDMSO = df[df[&#39;batch_id&#39;] == &#39;[dmso]&#39;] dfDMSO_Medians = dfDMSO[phenotype_features].median() dfDMSO_MADs = (dfDMSO[phenotype_features] - dfDMSO[phenotype_features].median()).abs().median() df_Zscores = df[phenotype_features].copy() df_Zscores = (df[phenotype_features] - dfDMSO_Medians[phenotype_features])/dfDMSO_MADs[phenotype_features] df_Zscores.clip(lower=-10, upper=10, inplace=True) In the plate separated approach, the same process was applied. However, it was done first by finding local median values for DMSO in each plate and normalizing the measurements in the same plate based on their respective DMSO medians. df_Zscores_by_plate = pd.DataFrame() for plate in plates: plate_data = df[df[&#39;Plate&#39;] == plate] df_DMSO = plate_data[plate_data[&#39;batch_id&#39;] == &#39;[dmso]&#39;] df_DMSO_medians = df_DMSO[phenotype_features].median() df_DMSO_MADs = (df_DMSO[phenotype_features] - df_DMSO[phenotype_features].median()).abs().median() Zscores = (df[df[&#39;Plate&#39;] == plate][phenotype_features] - df_DMSO_medians[phenotype_features])/df_DMSO_MADs[phenotype_features] df_Zscores_by_plate = pd.concat([df_Zscores_by_plate, Zscores]) df_Zscores_by_plate 2.2.1.2 Dimensionality Reduction In this part, several key steps were undertaken to reduce the dimensionality of the data, select the most informative features, and visualize the structure and variability of the data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA was applied to the dataset to identify the key direction or “a component” that describes most of the data variability. This process helps to transform the original dataset into an updated one where each data point is represented in terms of this component. The PCA algorithm also provides the loadings, or the contribution of each original feature to each principal component. from pca import pca import matplotlib.pyplot as plt X = covid_df.loc[(covid_df[&#39;label&#39;] == &#39;DMSO&#39;) | (covid_df[&#39;label&#39;] == &#39;Uninfected&#39;) | (covid_df[&#39;label&#39;] == &#39;Remdesivir&#39;)][features].values row_label = covid_df.loc[(covid_df[&#39;label&#39;] == &#39;DMSO&#39;) | (covid_df[&#39;label&#39;] == &#39;Uninfected&#39;) | (covid_df[&#39;label&#39;] == &#39;Remdesivir&#39;)][&#39;label&#39;] PCA_model = pca(n_components=10, detect_outliers=[&#39;ht2&#39;, &#39;spe&#39;]) results = PCA_model.fit_transform(X, col_labels=features, row_labels=row_label) PCA_model.plot(figsize=(12, 6)) Using outlier detection method like the Hotelling T2 test and the squared prediction error (SPE/DmodX) just one outlier were found in the data which was decided to remain in data. fig, axes = plt.subplots(ncols=2, figsize=(17,8)) ax1 = PCA_model.scatter(SPE=True, hotellingt2=True, cmap=&#39;tab10&#39;, ax=axes[0]) ax2 = PCA_model.biplot(SPE=True, hotellingt2=True, fontdict={&#39;size&#39;: 8}, cmap=&#39;tab10&#39;, PC=[0,1,2], ax=axes[1]) plt.show() The loading values obtained from PCA were subsequently utilized as input for a k-means clustering algorithm, enabling the clustering of features according to their loadings. The idea is to find the features that provide same information and cluster them together. The process begins with the execution of PCA, which is then followed by the deployment of k-means clustering on the PCA loadings. This arrangement allows features to be clustered based on their loadings. This can be construed as their significance or contribution to the data variance then a new feature is calculated for every cluster. This feature represents the average of all features contained within that specific cluster. def feature_reducer(df, feature_list, loading_dim=32, feat_output_dim=32): import pandas as pd from sklearn import preprocessing from sklearn.decomposition import PCA from sklearn.cluster import KMeans df_dsmo_uninfected_remi = df.loc[(df[&#39;label&#39;] == &#39;DMSO&#39;) | (df[&#39;label&#39;] == &#39;Uninfected&#39;) | (df[&#39;label&#39;] == &#39;Remdesivir&#39;)][feature_list] X = df_dsmo_uninfected_remi.values pca = PCA() pca.fit(X) loadings = pca.components_ loading_data = pd.DataFrame(loadings[:loading_dim]).T.values # Perform k-means clustering kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=feat_output_dim, random_state=42, n_init=100).fit(loading_data) # Get cluster assignments for each point labels = kmeans.labels_ for i in range(feat_output_dim): exec(f&#39;f_{i+1}&#39; + f&#39;= loading_data[labels == {i}]&#39;) f = pd.DataFrame({&#39;features&#39; : df_dsmo_uninfected_remi.columns.values, &#39;cluster&#39;: labels}).groupby(&quot;cluster&quot;).agg(list) column_list = list(df.columns) for feat in feature_list: column_list.remove(feat) new_df = df.loc[:,column_list].copy() # new_df = df.loc[:,list(set(df.columns) - set(feature_list))].copy() for i, f_list in enumerate(f[&#39;features&#39;]): new_df[f&#39;f{i+1}&#39;] = df[f_list].apply(lambda x: x.mean() , axis=1) return new_df, f In another approach to reduce the dimension, each feature’s ability to differentiate between the classes was evaluated by calculating the area of the triangle formed by the centroids of the classes in the feature space when we just use that specific feature and one highly related parameter to differentiate classes (for instance feature vs. number of nuclei) to plot all the points. For this, the centroids of the three distinct categories (‘Compound’, ‘Uninfected’, ‘Remdesivir’) for each feature ~ number of nuclei plot have been calculated. The area of the triangle formed by these centroids and the distance between them has been computed. This quantifies the separation between the three categories using each feature and helps to find the most descriptive feature. Features resulting in larger triangle areas were considered more informative. import math import numpy as np def area_of_triangle(p1, p2, p3): # Calculate the length of each side of the triangle a = math.sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0])**2 + (p2[1] - p1[1])**2) b = math.sqrt((p3[0] - p2[0])**2 + (p3[1] - p2[1])**2) c = math.sqrt((p3[0] - p1[0])**2 + (p3[1] - p1[1])**2) # Calculate the semiperimeter of the triangle s = (a + b + c) / 2 # Calculate the area using Heron&#39;s formula area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) return area def distance_between_centroids(centroid1, centroid2): # Calculate the distance using the distance formula distance = np.sqrt((centroid2[0] - centroid1[0])**2 + (centroid2[1] - centroid1[1])**2) return distance scaler = preprocessing.StandardScaler(with_mean=True, with_std=True) scaled_df = covid_df.copy() scaled_df.loc[:, features] = scaler.fit_transform(scaled_df.loc[:, features]) scores = [] comp_remi = [] comp_uni = [] remi_uni = [] for feat in features[1:]: compound_coords = scaled_df.loc[scaled_df[&#39;label&#39;] == &#39;compound&#39;,[&#39;Count_nuclei&#39;,feat]].values uninfected_coords = scaled_df.loc[scaled_df[&#39;label&#39;] == &#39;Uninfected&#39;,[&#39;Count_nuclei&#39;,feat]].values remidesivir_coords = scaled_df.loc[scaled_df[&#39;label&#39;] == &#39;Remdesivir&#39;,[&#39;Count_nuclei&#39;,feat]].values compound_centroid = np.mean(compound_coords, axis=0) uninfected_centroid = np.mean(uninfected_coords, axis=0) remidesivir_centroid = np.mean(remidesivir_coords, axis=0) area = area_of_triangle(compound_centroid, uninfected_centroid, remidesivir_centroid) comp_remi_dist = distance_between_centroids(compound_centroid, remidesivir_centroid) comp_uni_dist = distance_between_centroids(compound_centroid, uninfected_centroid) remi_uni_dist = distance_between_centroids(remidesivir_centroid, uninfected_centroid) scores.append(area) comp_remi.append(comp_remi_dist) comp_uni.append(comp_uni_dist) remi_uni.append(remi_uni_dist) feat_score = pd.DataFrame({&#39;feat&#39;: features[1:], &#39;score&#39;: scores, &#39;comp_remi&#39;:comp_remi, &#39;comp_uni&#39;:comp_uni, &#39;remi_uni&#39;: remi_uni}) The features have been ranked based on the calculated area, seen as a measure of separation between the categories. The top 50 features have been selected. Between the first 50 features all annotated with MITO were removed because they bias our model. Therefore, 16 features remain as our selected features. list(feat_score.sort_values(by=[&quot;score&quot;], ascending=False).head(50)[&#39;feat&#39;]) Finally, PCA has been performed again, this time exclusively on the selected features. Link to see interactive plot The PCA results demonstrate that the 10 principal components can now explain a very high percentage (99.91%) of the variance. The first principle component improved from describing 75.1 percent of variance to 93.0 percent. This indicates that the selected features capture most of the data variability. The value of PC1 was used for regression models as the target value. 2.2.1.3 Development of a binary classification of data In this part, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and Empirical Confidence Regions (2d confidence intervals based on binned kernel density estimate) were utilized to inform the development of a binary classification model for identifying active and inactive compounds based on their PCA1 values. Firstly, a two-dimensional KDE was performed on the compounds’ PCA1 and PCA2 values. This KDE plot provided a comprehensive understanding of the distribution of data points in the PCA space. It highlighted two distinct clusters corresponding to active and inactive compounds. The KDE plot was further enhanced by overlaying empirical confidence regions on it. These regions were derived from the mean and covariance of the PCA1 and PCA2 values for each cluster. Two standard deviation ellipses were used, approximating 90% confidence regions for the location of the true mean of each cluster in the PCA space. import numpy as np import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from matplotlib.patches import Ellipse mean1 = df_cluster1[[&#39;PC1&#39;, &#39;PC2&#39;]].mean() cov1 = df_cluster1[[&#39;PC1&#39;, &#39;PC2&#39;]].cov() mean2 = df_cluster2[[&#39;PC1&#39;, &#39;PC2&#39;]].mean() cov2 = df_cluster2[[&#39;PC1&#39;, &#39;PC2&#39;]].cov() fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7, 4)) # Draw the KDE plot sns.kdeplot(data=df_clust, x=&#39;PC1&#39;, y=&#39;PC2&#39;, fill=True, ax=ax) # Draw the confidence ellipses for mean, cov in [(mean1, cov1), (mean2, cov2)]: eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eigh(cov) order = eigenvalues.argsort()[::-1] eigenvalues, eigenvectors = eigenvalues[order], eigenvectors[:, order] vx, vy = eigenvectors[:,0] theta = np.arctan2(vy, vx) # Draw a 2*2.146 ellipse for 90 % CI ellipse = Ellipse(xy=mean, width=2*2.146**np.sqrt(eigenvalues[0]), height=2*2.146**np.sqrt(eigenvalues[1]), angle=np.degrees(theta), edgecolor=&#39;red&#39;, facecolor=&#39;none&#39;) ax.add_patch(ellipse) plt.show() The intersection of these confidence regions was then examined. The PCA1 value of 5 at this intersection was hypothesized to be an effective threshold for binary classification of compounds. Any compound with a PCA1 value greater than this threshold was classified as ‘active’, and any compound with a PCA1 value less than this threshold was classified as ‘inactive’. Importantly, this approach allowed the study to estimate a suitable classification threshold but also to visualize the uncertainty around this threshold and the potential overlap between the two classes. The method provided a data-driven way to set the classification threshold and offered insights into the inherent complexity of the data. It should be noted that the assumptions of the Gaussian distribution and independent identically distributed data inherent to this method may not hold in all cases. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution. Further, the use of PCA1 values alone for classification may oversimplify the problem if the active and inactive compounds differ along other principal components as well. Therefore, additional analyses are recommended to validate and refine this binary classification model. 2.2.2 Compound, Protein and Pathway Data Aggregation In the cell profiling data, the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) was incorporated to represent the chemical structure. The COVID-19 cell painting experiments that was carried out, was involved cell perturbations with over 5000 compounds. To uncover potential information regarding the protein binding capabilities and the pathways and assays in which these compounds are active, a highly recognized cross-reference annotation was necessitated. The PubChem Chemical ID (CID) serves as an exhaustive cross-reference annotation for chemicals. The initial step involved the determination of the CIDs for all the chemical compounds. These identifiers were subsequently utilized for the aggregation of additional protein and pathway data. This approach facilitated finding the activity of the compounds within the biological systems. import pubchempy as pcp chemical_smiles = list(df[&#39;smiles&#39;].values) cids = [] for smiles in chemical_smiles: try: c = pcp.get_compounds(smiles, &#39;smiles&#39;) if c: cids.append(c[0].cid}) else: print(f&#39;No compound found for SMILES: {smiles}&#39;) except Exception as e: print(f&#39;Error occurred: {e}&#39;) The COVID-19 dataset consisted of compounds screened for potential activity against SARS-CoV-2. To analyze the associations between these compounds and proteins, an auxiliary dataset, sourced from the STITCH database, was utilized. The STITCH database provides information about interactions between chemicals and proteins. These connections were then indexed and collated to create a list of compounds with and their association with proteins. Further, the connection between chemical compounds and their corresponding biological pathways was established through the following steps: Initially, assay summaries for a selection of compounds were obtained from the PubChem database. These summaries provided information about various biological assays performed on the compounds, specifically emphasizing on the target gene IDs that interacted with the compounds during these assays. Only the assays reporting an ‘Active’ outcome and a non-empty target gene ID were retained for further analysis. from io import StringIO import polars as pl import pubchempy as pcp comp_gid = pl.read_csv(&#39;data/comp_gid.tsv&#39;, separator=&#39;\\t&#39;) cids = comp_gid.select([&#39;pubchem_cid&#39;]).to_series().to_list() cid_genid_df = pl.DataFrame( schema={&#39;CID&#39;: pl.Int64, &#39;AID&#39;: pl.Int64, &#39;Target GeneID&#39;: pl.Utf8, &#39;Activity Value [uM]&#39;: pl.Float64, &#39;Assay Name&#39;: pl.Utf8} ) for cid in cids[:10]: try: csvStringIO = StringIO(pcp.get(cid, operation=&#39;assaysummary&#39;, output=&#39;CSV&#39;).decode(&quot;utf-8&quot;)) dictdf = pl.read_csv(csvStringIO, dtypes={&#39;Activity Value [uM]&#39;: pl.Float64}) ciddf = dictdf.filter( (pl.col(&quot;Activity Outcome&quot;) == &quot;Active&quot;) &amp; (pl.col(&quot;Target GeneID&quot;) != &quot;&quot;) ).unique( subset=&#39;Target GeneID&#39; ).select( [&#39;CID&#39;, &#39;AID&#39;, &#39;Target GeneID&#39;, &#39;Activity Value [uM]&#39;, &#39;Assay Name&#39;] ) except: ciddf = pl.DataFrame( schema={&#39;CID&#39;: pl.Int64, &#39;AID&#39;: pl.Int64, &#39;Target GeneID&#39;: pl.Utf8, &#39;Activity Value [uM]&#39;: pl.Utf8, &#39;Assay Name&#39;: pl.Utf8} ) cid_genid_df = cid_genid_df.vstack(ciddf) cid_genid_df.write_csv(&#39;comp_geneid.tsv&#39;, separator=&#39;\\t&#39;) Subsequently, the list of unique target gene IDs was utilized to extract associated biological pathways from the PubChem database. These pathways, sourced from the WikiPathways database, link each gene ID to one or multiple biological pathways. import polars as pl import pubchempy as pcp gene_id_list = cid_genid_df.select(pl.col(&#39;Target GeneID&#39;).cast(pl.Int64, strict=True)).unique(subset=&#39;Target GeneID&#39;, maintain_order=True).to_series().to_list() genid_wpw_df = pl.DataFrame(schema={&#39;Target GeneID&#39;: pl.Object, &#39;Wiki Pathway&#39;: pl.Utf8}) for gene_id in gene_id_list: try: ptw_list = pcp.get_json(gene_id, namespace=&#39;geneid&#39;, domain=&#39;gene&#39;, operation=&#39;pwaccs&#39;)[&#39;InformationList&#39;][&#39;Information&#39;][0][&#39;PathwayAccession&#39;] wp = [i[13:] for i in list(filter(lambda x: &#39;WikiPathways&#39; in x, ptw_list))] temp_df = pl.DataFrame({&#39;Target GeneID&#39;:gene_id, &#39;Wiki Pathway&#39;: wp}) except: temp_df = pl.DataFrame({&#39;Target GeneID&#39;:gene_id, &#39;Wiki Pathway&#39;: &#39;&#39;}) genid_wpw_df = genid_wpw_df.vstack(temp_df) genid_wpw_df.write_csv(&#39;geneid_wpw.tsv&#39;, separator=&#39;\\t&#39;) Gene ID fetched from these databases can be converted to STITCH database annotation by using BIIT API: import requests r = requests.post( url=&#39;https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/api/convert/convert/&#39;, json={ &#39;organism&#39;:&#39;hsapiens&#39;, &#39;target&#39;:&#39;ENSP&#39;, &#39;query&#39;:gene_id_list, &#39;numeric_namespace&#39;: &#39;ENTREZGENE_ACC&#39; } ) pl.DataFrame(r.json()[&#39;result&#39;]).select([&#39;incoming&#39;, &#39;converted&#39;, &#39;name&#39;, &#39;description&#39;]) Hence, a linkage from chemical compounds to biological pathways was constructed by associating compounds with target gene IDs from assays, and then connecting these gene IDs to biological pathways. This method of data preparation facilitated the exploration of potential mechanisms of action of compounds. It also provided an understanding of the biological processes potentially influenced by these compounds. It should be noted, however, that this is a simplified representation of the actual biological interactions, which are inherently more complex. These curated lists of compounds, proteins, and pathways served as the foundation for constructing a multimodal graph. In this graph, the nodes represent compounds, proteins, and pathways while the edges depict the connections between them. 2.2.3 Featurizing the Biomedical Entities In machine learning, featurization converts biomedical entities, which are often three-dimensional entities like chemicals and proteins, into a format that can be understood and processed by algorithms. Essentially, it involves converting the structure and properties into numerical vectors. It is necessary because machine learning algorithms work with numerical data rather than understanding biological structures and properties directly. Featurization is accomplished through the application of different algorithm and ways which will be discussed in following section. 2.2.3.1 Featurizing Compounds Starting with MACCS fingerprints, these are binary representations of a molecule based on the presence or absence of 167 predefined structural fragments. MACCS fingerprints are popular due to their simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness at capturing structural information. import deepchem as dc feat = dc.feat.MACCSKeysFingerprint() maccs_fp = feat.featurize(smiles) Morgan fingerprints, also known as circular fingerprints, are another type of molecular descriptor. They are generated by iteratively hashing the environments of atoms in a molecule. These fingerprints are characterized by their flexibility, as their radius and length can be adjusted. This allows for various levels of specificity in the representation of molecular structures. import deepchem as dc feat = dc.feat.CircularFingerprint(size=2048, radius=1) morgan_fp = feat.featurize(smiles) PubChem fingerprints are binary fingerprints consisting of 881 bits, each representing a particular chemical substructure or pattern. They were specifically designed for use with the PubChem database and provide detailed chemical structure encoding. import pubchempy as pcp cids = list(df.pubchem_cid[df[&#39;label&#39;]==&#39;compound&#39;]) bit_list = [] for cid in tqdm(cids): try: pubchem_compound =pcp.get_compounds(cid)[0] pubchem_fp = [int(bit) for bit in pubchem_compound.cactvs_fingerprint] bit_list.append(pubchem_fp) except: print(f&#39;No PubChem FP found for {cid}&#39;) bit_list.append([]) pc_fp = np.asarray(bit_list) The Mol2Vec fingerprint is inspired by the Word2Vec algorithm in Natural Language Processing. It considers molecules as sentences and SMILES as words, thus converting molecules into continuous vectors. This technique captures not only the presence of particular substructures but also their context within the molecule, providing a more nuanced representation. import deepchem as dc feat = dc.feat.Mol2VecFingerprint() m2v_fp = feat.featurize(smiles) In computational chemistry and drug discovery, molecules’ pre-treatment plays a crucial role in preparing them for machine learning applications. Molecules undergo optimization, where their 3D structure is refined and all possible conformations are explored. This step is vital as the 3D structure heavily influences various properties, such as reactivity and binding affinity. For Mordred and RDKit to compute all descriptors, we must optimize molecules and find their most energetically favorable conformations. from rdkit import Chem from rdkit.Chem import AllChem from threading import active_count num_thread = active_count() def optimize_3d(mol, method): mol = Chem.AddHs(mol) # Generate initial 3D coordinates params = AllChem.ETKDG() params.useRandomCoords=True params.maxAttempts=5000 AllChem.EmbedMolecule(mol, params) try: if method == &#39;MMFF&#39;: # optimize the 3D structure using the MMFF method (suitable for optimizing small to medium-sized molecules) AllChem.MMFFOptimizeMolecule(mol, maxIters=200, mmffVariant=&#39;MMFF94s&#39;) elif method == &#39;LOPT&#39;: # optimize the 3D structure using a combination of UFF and MMFF methods (can be used for optimizing larger and more complex molecules) # create a PyForceField object and set its parameters ff = AllChem.UFFGetMoleculeForceField(mol) ff.Initialize() ff.Minimize() AllChem.OptimizeMolecule(ff, maxIters=500) elif method == &#39;CONFOPT&#39;: # optimize each conformation using the PyForceField object (to explore the conformational space of a molecule and identify the most energetically favorable conformations) # generate 10 conformations using UFF # create a PyForceField object and set its parameters AllChem.EmbedMultipleConfs(mol, numConfs=10) ff = AllChem.UFFGetMoleculeForceField(mol) ff.Initialize() ff.Minimize() AllChem.OptimizeMoleculeConfs(mol, ff, maxIters=300, numThreads=num_thread) else: print(f&quot;method should be from {[&#39;MMFF&#39;, &#39;LOPT&#39;, &#39;CONFOPT&#39;]}&quot;) except: pass return mol RDKit descriptors include a comprehensive set of descriptors calculated directly from the molecule’s structure. These descriptors encompass a wide range of molecular properties, including size, shape, polarity, and topological characteristics. They are widely used in QSAR modeling and virtual screening applications due to their comprehensive nature. from rdkit import Chem from rdkit.Chem import Descriptors # Define a function to calculate all the possible descriptors def calculate_descriptors(smiles, idx): mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles) try: mol = optimize_3d(mol, &#39;LOPT&#39;) except: pass desc_lst = [] for descriptor_name, descriptor_function in Descriptors.descList: try: descriptor_value = descriptor_function(mol) if descriptor_value == pd.notnull: print(f&#39;No value for {descriptor_name}, output: {descriptor_value} for {idx}:{smiles}&#39;) desc_lst.append(np.nan) else: desc_lst.append(descriptor_value) except: pass return desc_lst descriptor_list = [] for idx, sml in enumerate(tqdm(smiles)): compound_desc = calculate_descriptors(sml, idx) descriptor_list.append(compound_desc) rdkit_desc_df = pd.DataFrame(descriptor_list, columns=[name for name, _ in Descriptors.descList]).astype(np.float64) rdkit_desc_df = rdkit_desc_df.dropna(axis=1) rdkit_desc = rdkit_desc_df.values.astype(np.float64) Finally, Mordred descriptors provide a vast array of over 1600 three-dimensional, two-dimensional, and one-dimensional descriptors. These descriptors represent a wide variety of chemical information, ranging from simple atom counts and molecular weight to more complex descriptors such as electrotopological state indices and autocorrelation descriptors. The rich information provided by Mordred descriptors makes them an excellent choice for modeling complex molecular behaviors. from mordred import Calculator, descriptors molecules = [Chem.MolFromSmiles(sml) for sml in smiles] # Define a function to calculate all the possible descriptors def calculate_mordred_descriptors(mol, optimization= &#39;LOPT&#39;): mol = optimize_3d(mol, optimization) # Create a Mordred calculator object calculator = Calculator(descriptors) return calculator(mol) mdrd_descriptor_list = [] for idx, mol in enumerate(tqdm(molecules)): mol_desc = calculate_mordred_descriptors(mol) desc = list(mol_desc.asdict().values()) mdrd_descriptor_list.append(desc) mordred_desc_df = pd.DataFrame(mdrd_descriptor_list, columns=list(mol_desc.asdict().keys())).astype(np.float64) mordred_desc_df = mordred_desc_df.dropna(axis=1) mordred_desc = mordred_desc_df.values.astype(np.float64) To summarize, the featureization process leverages multiple molecular descriptors to capture molecular structures’ complexity and diversity. Each descriptor contributes unique information about the molecule, resulting in a comprehensive and informative representation.

These models are trained to understand protein sequence patterns, structures, and dependencies. Thus, the resulting embeddings capture a wealth of information about protein sequences, including their evolutionary context, structural features, and biological functions. BioTransformers is a Python package that provides a unified API to use and evaluate several pre-trained models for protein sequences. These models transform protein sequences into meaningful numerical representations, also known as embeddings. The extracted embeddings can then be used in downstream machine learning tasks such as protein classification, clustering, or prediction of protein properties. The models you’ve selected, protbert and esm1_t34_670M_UR100, are two different pre-trained models available in BioTransformers. ProtBert is a transformer-based model trained on a large corpus of protein sequences using a masked language modeling objective, similar to BERT models in natural language processing. The model’s architecture enables it to capture complex patterns and dependencies in the sequence data. On the other hand, esm1_t34_670M_UR100 is part of the ESM (Evolutionary Scale Modeling) series of models, specifically trained on a large evolutionary scale of protein sequences. This model is designed to capture evolutionary patterns and sequence conservation information, which can be highly beneficial for protein-related tasks. from biotransformers import BioTransformers from tqdm.notebook import tqdm import torch import numpy as np import pandas as pd import pickle def compute_embeddings(bio_trans, sequences, batch_size=10): embeddings = np.empty((0,1024), float) for idx in tqdm(range(0, len(sequences), batch_size)): batch = sequences[idx:idx+batch_size] embd = bio_trans.compute_embeddings(batch, pool_mode=&#39;mean&#39;, batch_size=batch_size, silent=True)[&#39;mean&#39;] embeddings = np.vstack((embeddings, embd)) return embeddings def save_embeddings(embeddings, filename): with open(filename, &quot;wb&quot;) as f: pickle.dump(embeddings, f) # Load sequences seq_df = pd.read_csv(&#39;sequence.tsv&#39;, sep=&#39;\\t&#39;) sequences = list(seq_df[&#39;sequence&#39;]) # Backends backends = [&quot;protbert&quot;, &quot;esm1_t34_670M_UR100&quot;] for backend in backends: # Clear GPU memory torch.cuda.empty_cache() print(f&quot;Processing with backend: {backend}&quot;) bio_trans = BioTransformers(backend, num_gpus=1) embeddings = compute_embeddings(bio_trans, sequences) save_embeddings(embeddings, f&quot;{backend}_embeddings.pkl&quot;) This rich representation can be leveraged in downstream tasks, improving the performance of various bioinformatics applications such as protein function prediction, protein-protein interaction prediction, and many others. By using pre-trained embeddings, one can also significantly reduce the computational cost and complexity associated with training deep learning models from scratch on large protein datasets. 2.2.3.3 Featurizing Pathways BERT tokenizer from the Hugging Face Transformers library, a pre-trained model, was chosen for its ability to perform natural language processing tasks such as tokenization to vectorize biological pathways. This process involved splitting the text into individual tokens and encoding them as numerical IDs that could be understood by the BERT model. Padding and truncation techniques were applied to ensure consistent sequence lengths during tokenization. This step was critical as pathway descriptions often varied in length. By padding shorter sequences and truncating longer ones, uniformity was achieved. This would simply allow the model recognize different pathways from each other. from transformers import BertTokenizer tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(&#39;bert-base-uncased&#39;) string_list = pathway_df.select(pl.col(&#39;Wiki Pathway&#39;)).to_series().to_list() # Tokenize the pathway descriptions tokenized_strings = tokenizer(string_list, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors=&#39;pt&#39;) # Retrieve the tokenized input IDs pw_vector = tokenized_strings[&#39;input_ids&#39;] 2.2.4 COVID-19 Bio-Graph Having all the data ready a multimodal graph was built that represents a complex network of interconnected biological entities - chemicals, proteins, and pathways. The graph contains 4,293 unique chemicals, each distinguished by a high-dimensional feature vector (4,272 features) that includes biochemical properties, SMILES strings, and phenotype features. The chemicals’ high-dimensional space has been condensed into a single feature PCA1 using dimensionality reduction techniques. from torch_geometric.data import HeteroData data = HeteroData() data[&#39;chemical&#39;].x = chemical_features.to(torch.float) # [num_chemicals, num_features_chemical] data[&#39;chemical&#39;].smiles = chemical_smiles # [num_chemicals] data[&#39;chemical&#39;].y = chemical_y.long() # [num_chemicals] data[&#39;chemical&#39;].pca1 = chemical_pca1.to(torch.float) # [num_chemicals] data[&#39;chemical&#39;].phenotype_feat = chemical_phenotype_feat.to(torch.float) # [num_chemicals, 16] for f, v in [(&#39;train&#39;, &#39;train&#39;), (&#39;valid&#39;, &#39;val&#39;), (&#39;test&#39;, &#39;test&#39;)]: idx = mask_df.select( [&#39;connected_compound_gid&#39;, &#39;mask&#39;] ).filter( pl.col(&#39;mask&#39;) == f ).select(&#39;connected_compound_gid&#39;).to_numpy().flatten() idx = torch.from_numpy(idx) maskit = torch.zeros(data[&#39;chemical&#39;].num_nodes, dtype=torch.bool) maskit[idx] = True data[&#39;chemical&#39;][f&#39;{v}_mask&#39;] = maskit data[&#39;protein&#39;].x = protein_esm_embeddings.to(torch.float) # [num_proteins, num_features_protein] data[&#39;protein&#39;].name = protein_names # [num_proteins] data[&#39;protein&#39;].seq = protein_sequences # [num_proteins] data[&#39;pathway&#39;].x = pathway_features.to(torch.float) # [num_pathways, num_features_pathway] data[&#39;pathway&#39;].name = pathway_names # [num_pathways] data[&#39;chemical&#39;, &#39;bind_to&#39;, &#39;protein&#39;].edge_index = torch.from_numpy(compound_protein_deges).t().contiguous() # [2, num_edges_bind] data[&#39;pathway&#39;, &#39;activate_by&#39;, &#39;chemical&#39;].edge_index = torch.from_numpy(pathway_compound_edges).t().contiguous() # [2, num_edges_activate] data[&#39;protein&#39;, &#39;governs&#39;, &#39;pathway&#39;].edge_index = torch.from_numpy(protein_pathway_edges).t().contiguous() # [2, num_edges_govern] The final output of this process was a HeteroData object from the PyTorch Geometric library, which represents a heterogeneous graph with various types of nodes and edges. This graph-based representation of the data encapsulates the interconnected nature of the compounds, proteins, and pathways, thereby providing a comprehensive overview of the interactions and associations within the COVID-19 cell profiling data. Our multimodal graph, a complex mesh of interconnected biological entities, represents a wealth of relationships between chemicals, proteins, and pathways. It illustrates the intricate dynamics prevalent in molecular biology, serving as a robust framework for advanced modeling tasks. Among the 4,293 chemicals, only 3,711 have known connections to at least one protein, whereas 1,376 chemicals are isolated, meaning they lack any known protein interactions. On the other hand, from the total of 16,733 proteins, 16,727 are known to interact with chemicals, leaving 2,839 proteins without any known chemical connections. The graph also models 1,117 unique biological pathways. Only 282 proteins are known to govern these pathways. Interestingly, 3,220 chemicals are linked to all pathways, underscoring chemicals’ pervasive influence in biological processes. A distinct subset of 582 chemicals connect exclusively to pathways, without any protein connections, and 6 proteins have pathway connections but no compound connections. Overall, the graph includes 4,293 chemicals and 16,733 proteins that have at least one known connection, either to proteins, pathways, or both. These connections, represented by the different types of edges, symbolize various biological interactions and regulatory mechanisms. The graph’s structure, supplemented by the additional attributes of each node type, provides a comprehensive data platform for downstream tasks. The graph were further masked with training, validation, and testing subsets using a stratified approach to maintain a uniform distribution of classes across all subsets. This enabled the creation of robust machine learning models capable of effectively learning from training data and generalizing to unseen data. 2.2.5 Representing Chemical Molecules as Graph In conventional drug discovery processes, chemical structures are often encoded as fixed-length feature vectors, which were explained in detail in the previous section (Featurizing). These vectors, while effective for some tasks, lack the nuanced structural information and context of the atoms and bonds within the molecule. Recently, graph-based representations of molecules have gained popularity in computational chemistry and cheminformatics. In this approach, each molecule is represented as a graph, where atoms are considered as nodes and bonds as edges. This representation retains the context of the molecule, allowing for more sophisticated analysis and understanding of the molecular structure. Each atom (node) and bond (edge) can be associated with features such as atom type, bond type, atom hybridization, whether the bond is in a ring, etc. Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) can then be used to learn complex patterns from these graph-structured data. The graph-based representation and the conventional vector-based representation each have their unique strengths. The graph representation can capture local structural information and long-range interactions in the molecule, while the vector-based representation can efficiently capture specific substructures or holistic properties like the physico-chemical characteristics of the molecule. The initial step was to convert molecular structures into graph-based representations. This conversion was achieved using the MolGraphConvFeaturizer from the DeepChem library. This generated node and edge features considering additional aspects such as chirality and partial charge. Two dataset classes were designed for classification task: CovidMolGraph_imbalance_classification and CovidMolGraph_balanced_classification. The imbalanced dataset will be used with weight on binary classes during the training. The balanced classification approach involved resampling the minority class in the training set to balance the class distribution, improving the model’s performance.These handled the unbalanced and balanced classifications of the dataset, respectively. import os import pickle import torch from typing import Callable, List, Optional from sklearn import preprocessing from tqdm import tqdm import deepchem as dc import polars as pl from rdkit import Chem import numpy as np from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from torch_geometric.data import ( Data, Dataset, InMemoryDataset ) class CovidMolGraph_imbalance_classification(InMemoryDataset): def __init__(self, root: str, transform: Optional[Callable] = None, pre_transform: Optional[Callable] = None, pre_filter: Optional[Callable] = None): super().__init__(root, transform, pre_transform, pre_filter) self.data, self.slices = torch.load(self.processed_paths[0]) @property def processed_file_names(self) -&gt;

In machine learning applications in chemistry, compound representation plays a crucial role. The traditional approach involves converting chemical compounds into numerical vectors using various algorithms. However, a new popular alternative approach is molecule graph representation. This treats the compound as a graph structure with atoms as nodes and bonds as edges. This method captures atom connectivity and spatial arrangement within the molecule, providing more detailed information. Conversely, the conventional vector conversion method transforms chemical compounds into fixed-length vectors by encoding molecular descriptors or fingerprints. Molecular descriptors encompass essential chemical properties, while fingerprints encode the presence or absence of specific substructures within the compound. Although vector representations are more concise and compatible with traditional machine learning algorithms, molecule graphs offer enhanced versatility and applicability to various chemistry tasks. Graph representations’ ability to leverage connectivity patterns and atom-level information leads to improved predictive performance and a deeper understanding of chemical phenomena. When comparing the two approaches, molecule graphs excel at explicitly capturing structural information and atom relationships, making them advantageous for tasks reliant on spatial arrangement or connectivity patterns. On the other hand, conventional vector representations are more compact and suitable for traditional machine learning algorithms, making them preferable for larger datasets or tasks that don’t require explicit structural information. Molecule graphs can handle inputs of variable sizes, accommodating molecules with different atom numbers, whereas vector representations typically require fixed-size inputs. However, vector representations may sacrifice some fine-grained structural details or substructure information that molecule graphs can capture. The GLMP (Graph-Level Molecular Predictor) model is designed to leverage both molecular graph representations and conventional vector representations in its architecture. The model combines the strengths of both approaches to enhance predictive performance and capture detailed structural information. import torch import torch.nn.functional as F from torch.nn import Linear, BatchNorm1d, ModuleList from torch_geometric.nn import TransformerConv, TopKPooling from torch_geometric.nn import global_mean_pool as gap, global_max_pool as gmp torch.manual_seed(42) device = torch.device(&#39;cuda&#39; if torch.cuda.is_available() else &#39;cpu&#39;) class GLMP(torch.nn.Module): def __init__(self, feature_size, model_params): super(GNN, self).__init__() embedding_size = model_params[&quot;model_embedding_size&quot;] n_heads = model_params[&quot;model_attention_heads&quot;] self.n_layers = model_params[&quot;model_layers&quot;] dropout_rate = model_params[&quot;model_dropout_rate&quot;] top_k_ratio = model_params[&quot;model_top_k_ratio&quot;] self.top_k_every_n = model_params[&quot;model_top_k_every_n&quot;] dense_neurons = model_params[&quot;model_dense_neurons&quot;] edge_dim = 11 self.conv_layers = ModuleList([]) self.transf_layers = ModuleList([]) self.pooling_layers = ModuleList([]) self.bn_layers = ModuleList([]) # Transformation layer self.conv1 = TransformerConv(feature_size, embedding_size, heads=n_heads, dropout=dropout_rate, edge_dim=edge_dim, beta=True) self.transf1 = Linear(embedding_size*n_heads, embedding_size) self.bn1 = BatchNorm1d(embedding_size) self.bn2 = BatchNorm1d(8192) self.bn3 = BatchNorm1d(4096) self.bn4 = BatchNorm1d(2048) # Other layers for i in range(self.n_layers): self.conv_layers.append(TransformerConv(embedding_size, embedding_size, heads=n_heads, dropout=dropout_rate, edge_dim=edge_dim, beta=True)) self.transf_layers.append(Linear(embedding_size*n_heads, embedding_size)) self.bn_layers.append(BatchNorm1d(embedding_size)) if i % self.top_k_every_n == 0: self.pooling_layers.append(TopKPooling(embedding_size, ratio=top_k_ratio)) # Linear layers self.linear1 = Linear(4784, 8192) self.linear2 = Linear(8192, 4096) self.linear3 = Linear(4096, 2048) self.linear4 = Linear(2048, 1) def forward(self, data): x, edge_attr, edge_index, batch_index, chem_features = data.x, data.edge_attr, data.edge_index, data.batch, data.chem_features # Initial transformation x = self.conv1(x, edge_index, edge_attr) x = torch.relu(self.transf1(x)) x = self.bn1(x) # Holds the intermediate graph representations global_representation = [] for i in range(self.n_layers): x = self.conv_layers[i](x, edge_index, edge_attr) x = torch.relu(self.transf_layers[i](x)) x = self.bn_layers[i](x) # Always aggregate last layer if i % self.top_k_every_n == 0 or i == self.n_layers: x , edge_index, edge_attr, batch_index, _, _ = self.pooling_layers[int(i/self.top_k_every_n)]( x, edge_index, edge_attr, batch_index ) # Add current representation global_representation.append(torch.cat([gmp(x, batch_index), gap(x, batch_index)], dim=1)) x = sum(global_representation) # chem_features concatenated with graph-level representations x = torch.cat([x, chem_features], dim=1) # Output block x = torch.relu(self.linear1(x)) x = F.dropout(x, p=0.7, training=self.training) x = self.bn2(x) x = torch.relu(self.linear2(x)) x = F.dropout(x, p=0.7, training=self.training) x = self.bn3(x) x = self.linear3(x) x = F.dropout(x, p=0.7, training=self.training) x = self.bn4(x) x = self.linear4(x) return x The core of the GLMP model is a graph neural network (GNN) implemented using PyTorch. The GNN takes molecular graphs as input and applies a series of graph convolutional layers to capture atom connectivity and spatial arrangement within the molecules. The graph convolutional layers are implemented using a variant of the Transformer architecture, called TransformerConv, which incorporates attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies. In addition to the graph convolutional layers, the GLMP model also includes traditional linear layers for further processing and prediction. These linear layers operate on the representations obtained from the graph convolutional layers and other features, such as chemical descriptors or fingerprints encoded as fixed-length vectors. The GLMP model consists of the following components: Graph Convolutional Layers: The model uses multiple graph convolutional layers, implemented as instances of the TransformerConv class, to capture structural information from the molecule graphs. These layers perform graph convolutions, incorporating attention mechanisms and edge features to enhance the model’s ability to capture atom relationships. Linear and Batch Normalization Layers: After each graph convolutional layer, the GLMP model applies linear transformations followed by batch normalization to further process the representations obtained. These layers help refine the representations and make them suitable for downstream tasks. Pooling Layers: The GLMP model includes pooling layers, specifically the TopKPooling class, which aggregates the node representations at certain intervals. The pooling layers help to condense the graph-level information and capture important features. Chemical Features: The GLMP model incorporates additional chemical features, such as molecular descriptors or fingerprints, encoded as fixed-length vectors. These features are concatenated with graph-level representations at a later stage of the model. Final Linear Layers: The GLMP model concludes with a series of linear layers, which further process the combined representations of the graph-level information and the additional chemical features. These layers progressively reduce the dimensionality of the representations and eventually output a single value for prediction. By combining graph convolutional layers, linear layers, pooling layers, and chemical features, the GLMP model can effectively capture the detailed structural information present in molecular graphs. This allows the model to handle inputs of variable sizes, accommodate different atom numbers, and make predictions based on both spatial arrangement and essential chemical properties. 2.3.2 Bio-Graph Integrative Classifier/Regressor (BioGIC/BioGIR) The Bio-Graph Integrative Classifier/Regressor (BioGIC/BioGIR) is envisioned as a model that assimilates information from the COVID-19 Bio-Graph, a complex network encapsulating different biological entities, such as chemical compounds, proteins, and pathways. This model performs classification or regression tasks based on the intricate relationships and interactions among these biological entities alongside the biological entities’ feature vectors. The COVID-19 Bio-Graph allows for a more comprehensive representation of interdependencies. The proposed BioGIC/BioGIR model aims to leverage this wealth of information combined with feature vectors that represent the relevant information about the nodes they represent. This is to predict the properties or behaviors of certain entities, such as identifying active chemical compounds. The BioGIC/BioGIR model architecture could be based upon a combination of different Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs). Graph Attention Network (GAT) convolution layer, is usually used for capturing the local neighborhood relationships of the nodes. GAT layer provides an attention mechanism allowing the model to weigh neighbor nodes differently based on their importance. Also, a sequence of Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) layers could be particularly beneficial for heterogeneous graphs, which are graphs with different types of nodes and edges. RGCN layers can learn separate weights for different types of edges, thereby modeling different types of relationships more accurately. GraphSAGE is another GCN that is a suitable general-purpose graph convolution operation and works reasonably well in many scenarios. It’s capable of generating embeddings for unseen data, which is an advantage if you expect to be working with active compounds that weren’t in your training data. However, it treats all neighbor nodes equally when aggregating their features, which might not be ideal in a heterogeneous graph where different types of nodes could have different importance. The model would also include appropriate optimization techniques and loss functions suitable for the task at hand. For a classification task, a cross-entropy loss function would be used, while for regression tasks, mean squared error or another suitable loss function could be employed. The training process would involve backpropagation and optimization of the weights to minimize the loss function. The BioGIC/BioGIR model, by virtue of its design, allows for the integration of the complex relationships among various biological entities present in the COVID-19 Bio-Graph. The decision to concatenate embeddings from each layer via a pooling mechanism versus passing messages serially through the layers depends on the specific task and data. Both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses, and they capture different types of information. Passing Messages in Series: This approach sequentially passes information through layers, with each layer potentially transforming and aggregating the information from the previous layer. This approach might be better suited if the task requires more abstract representations, as the information is aggregated and transformed across layers. However, one potential drawback is that information from the initial layers could be lost or diluted in this process. from torch_geometric.nn import GATConv, RGCNConv, SAGEConv class BioGI(torch.nn.Module): def __init__(self, hidden_channels, out_channels): super().__init__() self.conv1 = GATConv((-1, -1), hidden_channels) self.conv2 = SAGEConv(hidden_channels, hidden_channels) self.conv3 = RGCNConv(hidden_channels, hidden_channels, num_relations=dataset.num_relations, num_bases=10) self.conv4 = RGCNConv(hidden_channels, out_channels, num_relations=dataset.num_relations, num_bases=10) def forward(self, x, edge_index, edge_type): x = self.conv1(x, edge_index).relu() x = self.conv2(x, edge_index).relu() x = self.conv3(x, edge_index, edge_type).relu() x = self.conv4(x, edge_index, edge_type) return F.log_softmax(x, dim=1) model = BioGI(hidden_channels=32, out_channels=dataset.num_classes) model = to_hetero(model, data.metadata(), aggr=&#39;sum&#39;) Concatenating Layer Embeddings: This approach can be beneficial as it allows the model to preserve and learn from information at different levels of abstraction. Each layer in a Graph Neural Network captures different types of information - initial layers capture local information, while deeper layers aggregate information from a larger neighborhood. Concatenating these embeddings can help the model leverage all this information simultaneously. Pooling mechanisms can be used to reduce dimensionality if needed. This approach might work well if the relevant information for the task is spread across different scales of the graph. from torch_geometric.nn import GATConv, RGCNConv, SAGEConv from torch.nn import Linear class BioGI(torch.nn.Module): def __init__(self, hidden_channels, out_channels): super().__init__() self.conv1 = GATConv((-1, -1), hidden_channels) self.conv2 = SAGEConv(hidden_channels, hidden_channels) self.conv3 = RGCNConv(hidden_channels, hidden_channels, num_relations=dataset.num_relations, num_bases=10) self.conv4 = RGCNConv(hidden_channels, out_channels, num_relations=dataset.num_relations, num_bases=10) self.fc = Linear(hidden_channels*4, out_channels) # Fully connected layer def forward(self, x, edge_index, edge_type): x1 = self.conv1(x, edge_index).relu() x2 = self.conv2(x1, edge_index).relu() x3 = self.conv3(x2, edge_index, edge_type).relu() x4 = self.conv4(x3, edge_index, edge_type).relu() x = torch.cat([x1, x2, x3, x4], dim=-1) # Concatenate along the last dimension x = self.fc(x) # Pass through the fully connected layer return F.log_softmax(x, dim=1) model = BioGI(hidden_channels=32, out_channels=dataset.num_classes) model = to_hetero(model, data.metadata(), aggr=&#39;sum&#39;) Skip connections or residual connections: Skip connections, also known as residual connections, are a technique used in deep neural networks to combat the vanishing gradient problem and to ease the training of deeper models. Skip connections work by adding the input to a layer to its output rather than directly feeding its output into the next layer. Through this approach, it is possible to maintain the flow of information and gradients through the network, thus making it easier to train deeper models. This is because during backpropagation, the gradients have a direct path through the skip connections, helping to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem where gradients can become very small and training can become difficult. from torch_geometric.nn import GATConv, RGCNConv, SAGEConv from torch.nn import Linear class BioGI(torch.nn.Module): def __init__(self, hidden_channels, out_channels): super().__init__() self.conv1 = GATConv((-1, -1), hidden_channels) self.conv2 = SAGEConv(hidden_channels, hidden_channels) self.conv3 = RGCNConv(hidden_channels, hidden_channels, num_relations=dataset.num_relations, num_bases=10) self.conv4 = RGCNConv(hidden_channels, out_channels, num_relations=dataset.num_relations, num_bases=10) self.skip = Linear(hidden_channels, out_channels) # Skip connection def forward(self, x, edge_index, edge_type): x1 = self.conv1(x, edge_index).relu() x2 = self.conv2(x1, edge_index).relu() + x1 x3 = self.conv3(x2, edge_index, edge_type).relu() + self.skip(x2) x4 = self.conv4(x3, edge_index, edge_type).relu() + self.skip(x3) return F.log_softmax(x4, dim=1) model = BioGI(hidden_channels=32, out_channels=dataset.num_classes) model = to_hetero(model, data.metadata(), aggr=&#39;sum&#39;) It’s difficult to say definitively which approach is more effective in this case without empirical testing. Both approaches could work well, and their performance may vary depending on the specifics of the data and task. It could be beneficial to implement both approaches and conduct experiments to determine which works best for your specific use case. 2.3.3 Optimized Molecular Graph Generator (OMG) There are several approaches implemented for this goal. For instance, in SMILES-based Generative Models, the model uses SMILES notation as a textual representation for molecules to train the model and generate the new molecules. Several generative models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or Transformer models, have been developed with this procedure to generate SMILES strings that correspond to novel molecules. In this workflow, for example, VAEs can be used for molecule generation, where the molecule is usually represented as a SMILES string or a graph to be encoded into a latent space. New points in this latent space can be decoded into new molecules. The VAE can be trained to ensure that similar points in the latent space correspond to molecules with similar properties. Other models, like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have also been used for molecule generation. The generator network in the GAN learns to generate new molecules, and the discriminator network learns to distinguish between actual molecules and molecules generated by the generator. By playing this adversarial game, the generator learns to generate more realistic molecules. Optimized Molecular Graph Generator (OMG) model is designed to generate graphs (molecules) and optimize a particular property, which in this study is the PCA1 value. The Graph Convolutional Policy Network (GCPN) and a flow-based autoregressive model for graph generation (GraphAF), which both are graph-based generative models were explored to overcome this task. Although they address the same problem, they have distinct mechanisms where GCPN, employing a reinforcement learning paradigm, makes decisions based on a reward function that evaluates the generated molecule’s quality based on its chemical properties. In contrast, GraphAF, an autoregressive model, generates each new atom and bond based on the atoms and bonds previously generated. Besides, GCPN incrementally generates molecules, choosing new atoms for addition and deciding their connections to the existing molecule based on the current policy, learned through reinforcement learning. Conversely, GraphAF generates molecules atom by atom and bond by bond sequentially, the generation process being deterministic and based on the current state. GCPN uses a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm to fabricate molecules with refined chemical properties. This method aims to create molecules with particular properties by setting specific goals. The central strategy uses Graph Convolutional Policy Network (GCPN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Graph Convolutional Policy Network (GCPN): In the framework of molecular data, the GCPN, a deep learning model developed for graph structures, is found particularly fitting. Molecules are naturally represented as graphs, with atoms and bonds serving as nodes and edges, respectively. GCPN, a graph-based generative model, applies policy gradient methods for molecule generation. The generation process is sequential, selecting new atoms for addition and determining their connections to the existing molecule. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): The PPO, a policy optimization method in reinforcement learning, aims at enhancing the policy while ensuring minimal deviation from the preceding policy. This approach aids in maintaining stability and securing reliable learning progress. Fine-tuning with RL: The GCPN model, once pretrained, undergoes fine-tuning using reinforcement learning. The RL model sharpens its policy for generating molecules under the guidance of a reward function that assesses the chemical properties of the molecules. The generation of molecules with improved properties, such as enhanced drug-likeness, solubility, or synthetic accessibility, is the chief objective. In the pretraining phase, a model is trained on a large dataset. The purpose of this step is to learn general features and patterns from the data. Here, the Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) model is trained on the ZINC250k dataset. The model is trained for 500 epochs with a batch size of 96. After the pretraining phase, the model is saved for later use. import torch from CovidMolGraph_TD import CovidMolGraphTD_imbalance from torchdrug import datasets, data, utils, core, models, tasks from torch import nn, optim torch.manual_seed(42) dataset_zinc250k = datasets.ZINC250k(&quot;./data/molecule-datasets/&quot;, kekulize=True, atom_feature=&quot;symbol&quot;) model = models.RGCN(input_dim=dataset_zinc250k.node_feature_dim, num_relation=dataset_zinc250k.num_bond_type, hidden_dims=[256, 256, 256, 256], batch_norm=False) task = tasks.GCPNGeneration(model, dataset_zinc250k.atom_types, max_edge_unroll=12, max_node=38, criterion=&quot;nll&quot;) optimizer = optim.Adam(task.parameters(), lr = 1e-3) solver = core.Engine(task, dataset_zinc250k, None, None, optimizer, gpus=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], batch_size=96, log_interval=100) solver.train(num_epoch=500) solver.save(&quot;./data/gcpn_dataset_zinc250k_500epoch.pkl&quot;) dataset_covid = CovidMolGraphTD_imbalance(&quot;./data/CovidMolGraphTD_imbalance&quot;) model = models.RGCN(input_dim=dataset_covid.node_feature_dim, num_relation=dataset_covid.num_bond_type, hidden_dims=[1024, 1024, 1024, 1024], batch_norm=True) task = tasks.GCPNGeneration(model, dataset_covid.atom_types, max_edge_unroll=12, max_node=38, criterion=&quot;nll&quot;) optimizer = optim.Adam(task.parameters(), lr = 1e-3) solver = core.Engine(task, dataset_covid, None, None, optimizer, gpus=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], batch_size=128, log_interval=1000) solver.train(num_epoch=1000) solver.save(&quot;./data/gcpn_dataset_ncovid_1000epoch_batchnormalization_1024.pkl&quot;) The next part of the experiment involves fine-tuning the pretrained model on a more specific task. This is where the model learns more task-specific patterns from a different dataset. In this case, the model is fine-tuned on a COVID-19 specific dataset using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, a reinforcement learning method. The learning rate is significantly lower than in the pretraining phase, indicating a more careful, incremental learning process. The model is trained for 100 epochs with a batch size of 16. Loading the pretrained model for fine-tuning is performed with the optimizer state not being loaded. This implies that while the model parameters are loaded from the pretrained model, the state of the optimizer (which could include momentum, adaptive learning rates, etc.) is reinitialized. Finally, the fine-tuned model is saved for further use or evaluation. The fine-tuned model is expected to perform better on the COVID-19 specific task than a model trained from scratch, thanks to the transfer of knowledge from the pretraining phase. This approach often reduces the amount of data required for the task-specific model and also shortens the training time. import torch from torchdrug import core, datasets, models, tasks from torch import nn, optim from collections import defaultdict model = models.RGCN(input_dim=dataset_covid.node_feature_dim, num_relation=dataset_covid.num_bond_type, hidden_dims=[256, 256, 256, 256], batch_norm=True) task = tasks.GCPNGeneration(model, dataset_covid.atom_types, max_edge_unroll=12, max_node=38, task=[&#39;pca1&#39;], criterion=&quot;ppo&quot;, reward_temperature=1, agent_update_interval=3, gamma=0.9) optimizer = optim.Adam(task.parameters(), lr=1e-5) solver = core.Engine(task, dataset_covid, None, None, optimizer, gpus=(0,), batch_size=16, log_interval=10) solver.load(&quot;./data/gcpn_dataset_zinc250k_500epoch.pkl&quot;,load_optimizer=False) # RL finetuning solver.train(num_epoch=100) solver.save(&quot;./data/gcpn_zinc250k_500epoch_finetune_covid_100epoch.pkl&quot;) GraphAF, however, sequentially generates molecules atom by atom and bond by bond. This approach is rooted in the concept of normalizing flows in deep learning. It employs an invertible mapping between the types of nodes (atoms) and edges (bonds) in the molecular graph and a noise distribution. The main components of GraphAF include: Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCN): The RGCN serves as the graph representation model in GraphAF. It is a variant of GCN designed to handle graphs with varied relations or edges. In molecular terms, diverse types of edges can represent different chemical bonds.By utilizing an RGCN, GraphAF can learn a more expressive representation of the molecular graph that considers the types of bonds. Autoregressive Generation: The training task for GraphAF, this process trains the model to generate the nodes and edges of the molecular graph sequentially. The generation process is autoregressive, implying that the generation of each new node or edge depends on the nodes and edges previously generated. Node Flow Model and Edge Flow Model: These components, integral to the autoregressive generation task, define an invertible mapping between the types of nodes and edges in the molecular graph and noise distribution. By implementing a node flow model and an edge flow model, GraphAF can generate a diverse set of molecules. 2.3.4 Model Enhancement: Ensembling and Self-Supervised Learning In machine learning, combining multiple models is one approach to making better predictions or decisions. The idea behind this method is that combining multiple models can lead to improved performance and more accurate results, as each model in the ensemble can capture different aspects of the underlying patterns in the data. In applying an ensemble approach to the BioGIC/BioGIR and GLMP models, the integration of GLMP’s latent embedding for node representation instead of the traditional feature vectors could enhance the performance of the BioGIC/BioGIR model. The reason is that the latent embeddings from the GLMP model encapsulate more relevant and nuanced information about the molecular structures in accordance with the task, and this may not be readily captured by simple feature vectors. As a result, the BioGIC/BioGIR model could benefit from this enriched representation, leading to a potentially more accurate classification or regression of biological entities. The ensemble approach, therefore, facilitates the incorporation of diverse perspectives and varied modelling of data patterns, thus potentially resulting in improved overall model performance. Another way to improve the performance of models is self-supervised learning. It is a method where models generate their labels from the input data and has become a powerful tool in predicting drug properties and molecule generation. Techniques such as InfoGraph operate on graph-structured data and maximize the mutual information between node-level and graph-level representations. Once trained, these models can generate meaningful representations of new graphs or nodes, proving useful in tasks like node classification, link prediction, or graph classification. In the context of our model, this method can be employed to improve GLMP (Graph-Level Molecular Predictor) model, where molecular properties identify potential drug candidates. Our generative model, OMG (Optimized Molecular Graph Generator), has already been utilized it with training the Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) model on the ZINC250k dataset. In the Optimized Molecular Graph Generator (OMG) model, incorporating the Graph-Level Molecular Predictor (GLMP) model plays a critical role in refining the generation process. By using the GLMP model, the OMG model’s reinforcement learning (RL) framework can effectively characterize and evaluate generated molecules based on their PCA1 value, a significant descriptor of molecular properties. This interaction allows for a more goal-oriented generation of molecules, driving the model towards creating molecules that optimize the targeted PCA1 value. Consequently, improvements made to the GLMP model directly influence the efficacy of the OMG model. Enhancements in GLMP’s ability to accurately predict molecular properties lead to more precise evaluations in the RL framework, thereby fostering the generation of higher-quality molecules. The symbiotic relationship between the OMG and GLMP models underscores the importance of improving the GLMP model, as it serves as a foundational component in achieving optimal molecule generation.
